# Automation and webscrapping

In this project, python code is used to automate the process of obtaining data from a website and adding the obtained
data to a Google form which can later be transformed into a Google sheet.

In particular, in this project I obtain prices address, and links to house listings from a renting website that meet certain predetermined criteria. The data is then processed and entered to a Google form.

The beautiful soup module is first used to obtain the required data, and selenium is used to automate the addition of
the data to a Google form.
